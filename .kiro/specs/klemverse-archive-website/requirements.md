# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The KlemVerse Archive is a website that serves as a bridge between the real world and role-playing (RP) activities. It functions as an event logging and archival system that tracks and displays activities, updates, and events in a structured format. The initial version (0.0.1) establishes the foundation for logging void events and displaying them in an accessible web interface. Version 0.0.2 introduces narrative progression with system prescience and anomaly detection, deepening the immersive RP experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Event Logging System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log events with timestamps and descriptions, so that I can maintain a chronological record of activities in the KlemVerse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new event occurs THEN the system SHALL record the event with a timestamp in HH:MM:SS format
2. WHEN an event is logged THEN the system SHALL store the event description and associated metadata
3. WHEN an event is created THEN the system SHALL assign it to a category (e.g., void_events)
4. IF an event has a timestamp THEN the system SHALL display it in 24-hour format

### Requirement 2: Archive Display Interface

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to view the KlemVerse Archive in a web browser, so that I can see the history of events and updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN the system SHALL display the archive title "KlemVerse Archive"
2. WHEN the archive loads THEN the system SHALL show the current version number (e.g., "update 0.0.1")
3. WHEN events exist THEN the system SHALL display them in a structured, readable format
4. WHEN displaying events THEN the system SHALL show the event category, timestamp, and description
5. IF multiple events exist THEN the system SHALL display them in chronological order

### Requirement 3: Event Categories and Organization

**User Story:** As a user, I want events to be organized by category, so that I can easily navigate different types of activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event is logged THEN the system SHALL support categorization (e.g., /void_events/)
2. WHEN displaying events THEN the system SHALL show the category path in a folder-like structure
3. WHEN a category is displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate visual indicators (e.g., üìÇ emoji)
4. IF an event belongs to a category THEN the system SHALL display the full category path

### Requirement 4: Real World Connection Display

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see how the real world connects to the RP world, so that I understand the context of logged events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the archive displays THEN the system SHALL show connection status messages (e.g., "Le monde r√©el est d√©sormais connect√© au RP")
2. WHEN an event represents a real-world action THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this connection
3. WHEN displaying events THEN the system SHALL support multilingual content (starting with French)

### Requirement 5: Responsive Web Design

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the website to work on different devices, so that I can access the archive from desktop or mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website loads on any device THEN the system SHALL display content in a responsive layout
2. WHEN viewed on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and usability
3. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout accordingly
4. IF the screen is small THEN the system SHALL ensure text remains readable without horizontal scrolling

### Requirement 6: Visual Design and Aesthetics

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the website to have an appealing and thematic design, so that it reflects the KlemVerse atmosphere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website loads THEN the system SHALL use a cohesive color scheme appropriate for an archive/log theme
2. WHEN displaying events THEN the system SHALL use clear typography and spacing
3. WHEN showing timestamps THEN the system SHALL use monospace or code-style formatting for clarity
4. IF emojis are used THEN the system SHALL ensure they enhance rather than clutter the interface

### Requirement 7: Version Progression and Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the archive evolve with new versions, so that I can follow the narrative progression of the KlemVerse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new version is released THEN the system SHALL update the version number display (e.g., "update 0.0.2")
2. WHEN viewing a specific version THEN the system SHALL display events relevant to that version
3. WHEN multiple versions exist THEN the system SHALL maintain chronological integrity across versions
4. IF a version introduces new narrative elements THEN the system SHALL integrate them seamlessly into the existing log structure

### Requirement 8: Character Action Logging

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see character actions and decisions logged, so that I can follow the story and character development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a character performs an action THEN the system SHALL log the action with timestamp and description
2. WHEN a character makes a decision THEN the system SHALL record the decision (e.g., "Klem a d√©cid√© d'ignorer VoidSync.exe")
3. WHEN displaying character actions THEN the system SHALL use consistent formatting with em dash (‚Äî) separator
4. IF a character interacts with system elements THEN the system SHALL log both the action and the element name

### Requirement 9: System Prescience and Meta-Narrative

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to experience the system's awareness and prescient knowledge, so that I feel immersed in the meta-narrative layer of the RP.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system displays prescient knowledge THEN it SHALL include commentary that suggests foreknowledge (e.g., "comme si le systeme savais deja ce que j'alais fait")
2. WHEN a character action is logged THEN the system MAY add meta-commentary about the action's implications
3. WHEN displaying system awareness THEN the system SHALL use italics or distinct styling to differentiate from regular logs
4. IF the system comments on events THEN the commentary SHALL enhance the narrative without breaking immersion

### Requirement 10: Anomaly Detection and Warnings

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see anomaly warnings and system alerts, so that I can anticipate narrative developments and feel tension building.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an anomaly is detected THEN the system SHALL log a warning message (e.g., "Une anomalie se pr√©pare")
2. WHEN displaying anomaly warnings THEN the system SHALL use distinct visual styling (color, icon, or formatting)
3. WHEN multiple events lead to an anomaly THEN the system SHALL maintain chronological order of the warning
4. IF an anomaly warning appears THEN the system SHALL ensure it stands out from regular event logs
