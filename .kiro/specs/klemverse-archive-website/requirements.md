# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The KlemVerse Archive is a website that serves as a bridge between the real world and role-playing (RP) activities. This is an ARG (Alternate Reality Game) / roleplay project conducted with ChatGPT. It functions as an event logging and archival system that tracks and displays activities, updates, and events in a structured format. The initial version (0.0.1) establishes the foundation for logging void events and displaying them in an accessible web interface. Version 0.0.2 introduces narrative progression with system prescience and anomaly detection, deepening the immersive RP experience. Version 0.0.3 expands the meta-narrative system with enhanced commentary types, visual glitch effects, external source detection, and dynamic terminal interactions.

### Requirement 9: System Prescience and Meta-Narrative

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to experience the system's awareness and prescient knowledge, so that I feel immersed in the meta-narrative layer of the RP.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system displays prescient knowledge THEN it SHALL include commentary that suggests foreknowledge (e.g., "comme si le systeme savais deja ce que j'alais fait")
2. WHEN a character action is logged THEN the system MAY add meta-commentary about the action's implications
3. WHEN displaying system awareness THEN the system SHALL use italics or distinct styling to differentiate from regular logs
