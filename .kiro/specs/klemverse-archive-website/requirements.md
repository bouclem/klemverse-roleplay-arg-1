# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The KlemVerse Archive is a website that serves as a bridge between the real world and role-playing (RP) activities. It functions as an event logging and archival system that tracks and displays activities, updates, and events in a structured format. The initial version (0.0.1) establishes the foundation for logging void events and displaying them in an accessible web interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Event Logging System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to log events with timestamps and descriptions, so that I can maintain a chronological record of activities in the KlemVerse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new event occurs THEN the system SHALL record the event with a timestamp in HH:MM:SS format
2. WHEN an event is logged THEN the system SHALL store the event description and associated metadata
3. WHEN an event is created THEN the system SHALL assign it to a category (e.g., void_events)
4. IF an event has a timestamp THEN the system SHALL display it in 24-hour format

### Requirement 2: Archive Display Interface

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to view the KlemVerse Archive in a web browser, so that I can see the history of events and updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN the system SHALL display the archive title "KlemVerse Archive"
2. WHEN the archive loads THEN the system SHALL show the current version number (e.g., "update 0.0.1")
3. WHEN events exist THEN the system SHALL display them in a structured, readable format
4. WHEN displaying events THEN the system SHALL show the event category, timestamp, and description
5. IF multiple events exist THEN the system SHALL display them in chronological order

### Requirement 3: Event Categories and Organization

**User Story:** As a user, I want events to be organized by category, so that I can easily navigate different types of activities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event is logged THEN the system SHALL support categorization (e.g., /void_events/)
2. WHEN displaying events THEN the system SHALL show the category path in a folder-like structure
3. WHEN a category is displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate visual indicators (e.g., ðŸ“‚ emoji)
4. IF an event belongs to a category THEN the system SHALL display the full category path

### Requirement 4: Real World Connection Display

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see how the real world connects to the RP world, so that I understand the context of logged events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the archive displays THEN the system SHALL show connection status messages (e.g., "Le monde rÃ©el est dÃ©sormais connectÃ© au RP")
2. WHEN an event represents a real-world action THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this connection
3. WHEN displaying events THEN the system SHALL support multilingual content (starting with French)

### Requirement 5: Responsive Web Design

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the website to work on different devices, so that I can access the archive from desktop or mobile.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website loads on any device THEN the system SHALL display content in a responsive layout
2. WHEN viewed on mobile THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and usability
3. WHEN the viewport size changes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout accordingly
4. IF the screen is small THEN the system SHALL ensure text remains readable without horizontal scrolling

### Requirement 6: Visual Design and Aesthetics

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want the website to have an appealing and thematic design, so that it reflects the KlemVerse atmosphere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website loads THEN the system SHALL use a cohesive color scheme appropriate for an archive/log theme
2. WHEN displaying events THEN the system SHALL use clear typography and spacing
3. WHEN showing timestamps THEN the system SHALL use monospace or code-style formatting for clarity
4. IF emojis are used THEN the system SHALL ensure they enhance rather than clutter the interface
